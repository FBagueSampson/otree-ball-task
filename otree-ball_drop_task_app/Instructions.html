        <p>In {{ C.DISPLAYED_SECTION_TITLE }} of this experiment, you will decide how to allocate <strong>{{ C.NUM_BALLS }} balls</strong> between 
            two buckets.</p>
        <p>Your task is to put each of the balls, one-by-one, into one of the two buckets: 
            the <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_01 }} bucket</span> or the 
            <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_02 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_02 }} bucket</span>.</p>
        <p>The balls will appear in the center of your screen, and you can allocate each ball by clicking and dragging it to the 
            bucket of your choice. For each ball you put in the <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_01 }} 
            bucket</span>, you will receive <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.PAYOFF_BUCKET_01 }} cents</span>, and for each ball 
            you put in the <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_02 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_02 }} bucket</span>, you will receive 
            <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_02 }}">{{ C.PAYOFF_BUCKET_02 }} cents</span>.</p>
        <p class="boldtype">The <span class="underlinetype">rule</span> is to put the balls into the 
            <span class="underlinetype {{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}" ><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_01 }}</span> bucket</span>.</p>
        <p>Once the task begins, you will have <strong>{{ C.MINUTES_FOR_TASK }} minutes</strong> to put the balls into the buckets. 
            <span class="underlinetype">The task ends immediately once time has run out</span>, even if you have not allocated all {{ C.NUM_BALLS }} balls.</p>
        <p>Your payment from {{ C.DISPLAYED_SECTION_TITLE }} will be based on your decisions: it is the <strong>sum of payments</strong> from the 
            <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_01 }}</span> and 
            <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_02 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_02 }}</span> buckets. </p>
    {{ else }}
        <p>The task for your chosen charity, {{ player_charity }}, is to decide how to allocate 
        <strong>{{ C.NUM_BALLS }} balls</strong> between two buckets.</p>
        <p>Your task is to put each of the balls, one-by-one, into one of the two buckets: 
        the <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_01 }} bucket</span> or the 
        <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_02 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_02 }} bucket</span>.</p>
        <p>The balls will appear in the center of your screen, and you can allocate each ball by clicking and dragging it to the 
        bucket of your choice. For each ball you put in the <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_01 }} 
        bucket</span>, <span class="underlinetype italictype boldtype">{{ player_charity }}</span> will receive 
        <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.PAYOFF_DICTATOR }} cents</span>, and for each ball 
        you put in the <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_02 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_02 }} bucket</span>, 
        <span class="underlinetype italictype boldtype">you</span> will receive 
        <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_02 }}">{{ C.PAYOFF_DICTATOR }} cents</span>.</p>
        <p>Once the task begins, you will have <strong>{{ C.MINUTES_FOR_TASK }} minutes</strong> to put the balls into the buckets. 
            <span class="underlinetype">The task ends immediately once time has run out</span>, even if you have not allocated all {{ C.NUM_BALLS }} balls. </p>
        <p>The anonymous donation that the researcher will make on your behalf to {{ player_charity }} from {{ C.DISPLAYED_SECTION_TITLE }} is based on 
            the number of balls you place in the <span class="{{ C.STYLE_BUCKET_01 }}">{{ C.COLOR_BUCKET_01 }} bucket</span>.</p>
